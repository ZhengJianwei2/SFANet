This is the code of our paper "ORSI Salient Object Detection via Hierarchically Progressive Semantic Flow and Lightweight Interaction-attention", currently submitting to TGRS. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact usï¼š"qyq@zjut.edu.cn" or "zjw@zjut.edu.cn"
## Highlight 
* To obtain feature maps with rich semantic information and critical object locations, two individual modules, namely semantic extraction module (SEM) and interscale fusion module (IFM), are meticulously designed that efficiently extract and merge semantic flow from a global
perspective.
* A lightweight interaction-attention module (LIAM) is proposed, which is specifically designed to suppress task-irrelevant information, highlighting the meaningful objects and enriching the representation of details in low-level features of saliency maps.
